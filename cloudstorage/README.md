## Introduction
This demo demonstrates an example of using the [SDK](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Library/agc-cloudstorage-sdkdownload-android-0000001056576373) to store images, videos, audio, or other files generated by users.


## Environment Requirements
* A computer with Android Studio installed for app development
* A device or an emulator in Android Studio running Android 4.2 or a later version

## Getting Started

1. Enable Cloud Storage in AppGallery Connect. The Cloud Storage service is not enabled by default.

2. Create a storage instance. When Cloud Storage is enabled, AppGallery Connect automatically creates a default storage instance. If you want to store app system data and user data separately, create a storage instance as required.

3. Integrate the Cloud Storage SDK if you need to use Cloud Storage-related functions in your app.

4. Initialize the storage instance. Before using Cloud Storage on an app, you must initialize the default storage instance or a storage instance in the specified region. 

5. Manage files. The app can call the APIs of the Cloud Storage SDK to perform operations such as uploading files, downloading files, deleting files, and modifying file metadata.
