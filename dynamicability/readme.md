## Introduction
The Dynamic Ability SDK is a set of solutions for HUAWEI AppGallery to dynamically load features by referring to the App Bundle technology. After integrating the Dynamic Ability SDK, third-party apps can download features from AppGallery when necessary, thus reducing network traffic and requiring less storage space on devices.
